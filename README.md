# WHAT IS THIS APP?
Check out the live version of [this app]().

This app was a fun project to simply understand twitters community sentiment accross any issue. 

Note: Sentiment scores do in no way indicate my views or oppinions or that of Twitter or Streamlit


# WHAT I LEARNED
- Streamlit
- Twitter API
- Hugging Face sentiment models

# Notes:
The [hugging face model](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest) this uses is 500MB 
and will download the first time you load the application in Streamlit locally. So just keep that mind.
Fun Fact: It is trained on over 124M Tweets from Jan 2018 to Dec 2021.
